    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A delicious beef and vegetable soup that is a variation on 
        the okra and tomato-based soup my great-grandmother 
        used to make on the farm in Alabama. It's great with 
        fresh or canned veggies, works with just about any 
        alterations - I use fresh, locally-grown ingredients 
        and it's always amazing. All ingredient measurements are 
        approximate. The important thing about Granny's okra soup 
        is that the tomato is the main ingredient, 
        but okra, lima beans and potatoes are important too. Adding 
        or subtracting other vegetables to taste or based on 
        availability is perfectly acceptable.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 cups chopped tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 cups lima beans</li>
            <li>2 cups chopped okra</li>
            <li>2 cups chopped red potatoes</li>
            <li>1 cup corn</li>
            <li>1 cup green beans</li>
            <li>½ cup chopped carrots </li>
            <li>1 (6 ounce) can tomato paste</li>
            <li>4 cups chicken stock</li>

            <li>1 pound ground beef</li>

            <li>½ tablespoon garlic powder</li> 

            <li>½ tablespoon celery salt</li>

            <li>½ tablespoon onion powder</li>

            <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>

            <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed, or more to taste</li>

            <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Combine tomatoes, lima beans, okra, potatoes, corn, green 
                beans, carrots, and tomato paste in a large soup pot. 
                Pour chicken stock over mixture and bring to a boil over 
                medium heat. Reduce heat and simmer until 
                vegetables begin to soften, about 15 minutes.</li>

            <li>Season ground beef with garlic powder, 
                celery salt, and onion powder. Set aside.</li>
            
            <li>Heat butter in a skillet over medium-high heat.
                 Add onion and garlic when butter stops bubbling; 
                 cook and stir for 1 minute. Spread ground beef evenly 
                 in the pan. Cook until it has a nice brown sear, 
                 stirring minimally to end up with mostly medium-sized 
                 chunks, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain skillet 
                and add beef, onions, and garlic to the soup pot.</li>

            <li>Bring soup mixture to a boil; reduce heat to 
                simmer, cover, and cook until vegetables 
                and beef have cooked down, 1 to 2 hours. </li>

        </ol>
