    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>'Piononos' are a Puerto Rican dish that have 
        sweet ripe plantains wrapped around a ground meat filling, 
        then breaded and fried. This fills my craving for them even 
        though it is layered and baked. I served this with basic 
        Puerto Rican white rice and a garden salad with avocado. 
        The meat filling can be made in bulk and frozen in batches for future use. 
        Delicious!</p>

                <li>1 tablespoon capers, drained and chopped</li>
                <li>¾ teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
                <li>¼ teaspoon dried oregano</li>
    
                <li>½ cup tomato sauce</li>
    
                <li>5 large plantains</li> 
    
                <li>¼ cup butter, softened </li>
    
                <li>¾ teaspoon white sugar</li>
    
                <li>2 tablespoons melted butter</li>
    
            </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). 
                    Butter a baking dish.</li>
    
                <li>Heat the canola oil in a large skillet 
                    over medium-high heat. Cook the ground pork 
                    and cooked ham in the hot oil until the pork is 
                    completely cooked and no longer pink, 
                    7 to 10 minutes. Remove from the skillet 
                    and set aside, reserving 2 tablespoons of
                    the drippings in the skillet.

                </li>
                
                <li>Reduce the heat to medium-low. Place the skillet 
                    over the heat and add the sofrito; cook and stir 
                    the sofrito for 5 minutes. Add the olives, capers, 
                    salt, garlic powder, oregano, and tomato sauce to
                    the sofrito; cook and stir another 5 minutes. Return
                     the ground pork and ham to the skillet and stir; 
                     simmer for 15 minutes, stirring a few times while 
                     it cooks.</li>
    
                <li>Bring a pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Rinse 
                    the plantains and cut off their tips, leaving the skin 
                    on; cut each plantain into 2 to 3 segments each about 
                    3 inches long. Cook the plantains in the boiling water 
                    until tender, about 15 minutes; drain and peel. Put the
                    peeled plantains in a mixing bowl and mash with a potato
                    masher. Add the softened butter and sugar; mix.</li>

                    <li>Spread about half of the plantain mixture into 
                        the bottom of the prepared baking dish. 
                        Layer the meat mixture over the plantains. 
                        Top with the remaining plantain mixture.</li>

                    <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Brush 
                        the top with the melted butter and continue baking
                         until the top is browned, about 10 minutes more. 
                         Remove from oven and allow to rest 10 to 15 minutes
                          before slicing to serve.</li>
